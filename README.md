# K-Nearest Neighbours Classification on Cancer Dataset

## Overview
This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to classify tumour samples as malignant or benign based on medical diagnostic features.

## Objectives
- Normalise and scale features for distance-based learning  
- Train KNN with various K-values  
- Choose optimal K using error analysis  
- Evaluate final model accuracy  

## Dataset
Breast Cancer dataset including:
- Radius  
- Texture  
- Smoothness  
- Concavity  
- Diagnosis label (target)

## Workflow Summary
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Scaling features using StandardScaler  

2. **Model Training**
   - Multiple K-values tested  

3. **Error Plotting**
   - Identify optimal K  

4. **Final Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Accuracy score  

## Results
- Optimal K produced high classification accuracy.
- Scaling significantly improved performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn
